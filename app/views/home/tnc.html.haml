          How do I recover lost data if my phone is lost or damaged?
        %p Orient Mobile clients have the option of buying a mobile device security solution that enables contact back-up and allows the user to remotely erase data from the device in case it is stolen. Please contact us if you are interested in this solution. Alternatively, you can use the numerous free data recovery solutions currently available in the market. Many smart-phones and tablets come with pre-installed applications or allow users to download applications that:
        %ul
          %li Back up device data (including contacts)
          %li Enable the user to remotely delete data
          %li Track the stolen device
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If I have multiple phones and/ or tablets, can I insure all of them?
        %p Yes. You can register multiple devices using the same National ID or Passport number. However, the cover for each device will have to be purchased separately and each device will have a unique policy number.
      %li
        %h3.subheader

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If I travel out of Kenya will my phone/ tablet still be covered?
        %p Yes, your phone/ tablet will continue to be covered for the first 30 days of each trip outside Kenya.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Is there a limit on the number of claims I can make per year?
        %p Yes, in order to ensure Orient Mobile remains an affordable product, the number of claims is limited to a maximum of two claims per device per year. The 2nd claim cannot be less than 31 days after the 1st claim.
        %p Additionally, if a person makes three claims (in total for all their devices) within 1 year, they will no longer be eligible to buy Orient Mobile for any more devices. However, any devices that were insured before lodging the 3rd claim will continue to be covered until the policies expire.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I buy an Orient Mobile policy if I am under the age of 18?
        %p No, you cannot because Orient Mobile is a contract and minors cannot enter into contracts. However, your parent or the adult who has registered the phone/ tablet SIM with the mobile network operator can buy the policy on your behalf.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If my phone or tablet is replaced after a theft or irreparable damage, will my new device be covered?
        %p After a device is declared lost or damaged beyond repair, the Orient Mobile cover for that device will expire and you will receive a replacement. Please take a new Orient Mobile policy for your replacement device by following the sign-up procedure. However, if your phone/ tablet is damaged and then repaired and returned to you, the Orient Mobile cover for that device will continue to be in force and you will not have to register again.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If I have an Orient Mobile policy will I have to pay anything additional to have my phone/ tablet repaired or replaced?
        %p If your phone/ tablet is damaged beyond repair or lost/ stolen, your additional cost for replacement of the device will be 10% of its insurance value, minimum KES 1,000. This first portion of a claim which is paid by the Insured is known as Excess. The payment of Excess is a standard practice for most classes of property insurance e.g. motor vehicle insurance, Fire insurance for residential and commercial buildings, insurance for business stock or equipment, etc.
        %p This Excess amount will be deducted from the value of the replacement you will be eligible for. For example, if you have insured your phone/ tablet for KES 15,000 and it gets lost or irreparably damaged, you will be given a credit of KES 13,500 (15,000 – 1,500) which you can redeem for a replacement at one of our authorized dealers.
        %p However, in case of a damage claim where your device is repaired and returned to you, you will not have to pay an additional amount.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          How will I know whether my damaged phone/ tablet should be repaired or replaced?
        %p Once you submit your damaged device and all accompanying documents to an authorized outlet, you will receive notification via SMS and email on whether your device will be repaired or replaced. You will receive this notification within 3 working days.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          When my phone/ tablet is lost/ stolen or damaged beyond repair can my replacement device be of any make & model?
        %p When you are eligible to receive a replacement device, we will send you an email and SMS confirming the amount of your Replacement Limit. This Replacement Limit will be the insurance value of the device less the Excess amount explained above. You can use the amount of the Replacement Limit towards the purchase of any phone or tablet sold by the dealer. You cannot use that amount towards the purchase of an alternative device such as a camera or computer.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I use my Replacement Limit to get a more expensive device?
        %p Yes. You can pay our authorized dealer in cash for the difference between your Replacement Limit and the price of the more expensive device you want. If, however, you redeem your Replacement Limit for a device that costs less than the amount of your Replacement Limit, you shall not receive a refund.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If my Replacement Limit is more than the cost of the replacement phone, can I use the balance towards the purchase of something else at the outlet?
        %p Yes. You can use the balance of your Replacement Limit to get an additional phone, tablet, charger, battery, cover or set of earphones.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If I sign up for Orient Mobile today can I make a claim immediately?
        %p When you sign up for Orient Mobile there is a 14-day waiting period for accidental physical damage claims. This means that if your device is damaged within the first 14 days of the policy period, that claim is not payable. However, if your device is lost or stolen, you can claim for it immediately.
  
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Does Orient Mobile only cover brand new devices?
        %p You can cover your phone/ tablet under Orient Mobile as long as it was bought in the current year or last year. Orient Mobile covers devices up to a maximum of 2 years. Therefore there are two scenarios:
        %ol
          %li If your sign up for Orient Mobile in the year of purchase of your device, you can insure it for 1 year and upon expiry, buy another 1-year policy. For example, if you bought your device in 2013, you can buy an Orient Mobile policy in 2013 and then buy another policy in 2014.
          %li If you sign up for Orient Mobile in the year after the year of purchase of your device, you can insure it once for 1 year. For example, if you bought your device in 2012, you can buy an Orient Mobile policy in 2013. However, you will not be eligible to buy another policy for that device in 2014.
  
        %strong The year of purchase you provide during the sign-up process MUST be the year of purchase indicated on the purchase receipt or warranty for the device.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I cover a phone or tablet that I bought second hand?
   
        %p 
          Yes, if you have the receipt. When making a claim under Orient Mobile, we will require you to submit the original or certified copy of the Electronic Tax Register (ETR) purchase receipt or a written confirmation of purchase and warranty on the letterhead of the authorized dealer who sold you the device. This receipt or warranty
          %strong 
            show the year of purchase that you provided when you signed up for the policy. Therefore, we advise you to only sign up for Orient Mobile for devices for which you have the original or certified copy of the ETR receipt or warranty showing the date of purchase.
          This ETR receipt or warranty must display the name of the dealer, the make & model of the device, the IMEI no. of the device, the date of purchase and the amount paid. Photocopied receipts must be certified by the retailer who sold you the device.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          I have the original receipt for my phone/ tablet but it is fading. Can I still use it to make a claim?
        %p We recommend that you make a copy (photocopy or scan) of your receipt before it fades and have the retailer certify this copy. Please store the original receipt with the photocopy and submit both when making a claim. Please note that claims submitted with photocopied receipts may take longer to process.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          At the time I bought my Orient Mobile policy I had a receipt but it is now lost or completely faded. Can I make a claim?
        %p In order to make an Orient Mobile claim you must have the original or certified copy of an ETR receipt or warranty that displays the name of the dealer, the make & model of the device, the IMEI no. of the device, the date of purchase and the amount paid. Please check with the authorized dealer who sold you the device to find out if they can re-print your receipt or certify the photocopy. Please note that claims submitted with photocopied receipts may take longer to process.

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          My ID/ Passport has been misplaced. How can I make a claim?
        %p In this case, please provide a completed police abstract with the details of your lost ID or passport. Please note that claims submitted with police abstracts in place of ID’s or Passports may take longer to process.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I choose the value for which I want to insure my phone/ tablet?
        %p No. The insurance value of your phone will be determined based on its make and model and year of purchase. Our database has a device catalogue with a set value for every make and model that we insure. We update these prices regularly in order to keep up to-date with the continually changing market prices of mobile devices. You will see the insurance value of your device during the sign-up process  before you make a payment. This is to ensure that you are comfortable with the insurance value before committing to an Orient Mobile policy.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          If I insure my phone/ tablet for the given insurance value and your catalogue prices change will the insurance value of my device also change?
        %p No it will not. Once you buy an Orient Mobile policy, the insurance value of your device remains the same for the entire policy period. In case your device is lost or damaged beyond repair, its replacement value will be based on the insurance value regardless of the catalogue/ market price at that time.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          How much does an Orient Mobile policy cost?
        %p The 1-year premium for your Orient Mobile policy will be determined during the sign-up process when our system identifies the make & model of your device and you confirm the year of purchase. The minimum annual premium to insure a device is KES 999.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I pay my Orient Mobile premium in instalments?
        %p You can pay your Orient Mobile premium in 3 equal monthly instalments. Towards the end of the first and second months of cover you will receive an SMS reminder to make your next payment in order to continue to cover your device. Please make this payment on or before the due date. If the payment is not made on or before the due date, your Orient Mobile policy will lapse and there will be no refund.
  
        %p Please note that you must finish paying your full annual premium before a claim can be registered and processed.
      %li
        %h3.subheader
          When I pay my premium in instalments will my device be covered for a full year?
        %p When you pay your premium in instalments, you will receive cover for 1 month, which will be extended to the end of the 12-month period when you make your final payment. For example, if you paid your 1st instalment on 1st August 2013, your policy dates would be as follows:

      %li
        %h3.subheader
          Can I sign-up for an Orient Mobile policy for my device using a different phone/ tablet?
        %p No. The sign-up process for Orient Mobile must be completed on the device that is to be insured. However, you can register a claim for your device or make an enquiry on your policy or claim using any phone/ tablet. The phone/ tablet must be able to access the internet in order for any of these processes to be completed on the device.
