            I have been talking about it to all my work colleagues. They didn’t believe it. I also didn’t believe in the Mobile insurance however I still took it up. My phone was stolen a month later and Kenya Orient replaced it within a week’s time. I still can’t believe it. The process to insure and claim is so easy. I have already taken up insurance for the replaced phone that I got from Fone Express. 
            Your customer service is very good, Thank you
